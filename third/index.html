      <div id='content'>Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. I started painting as a hobby when I was little. I didn't know I had any talent. I believe talent is just a pursued interest. Anybody can do what I do. Use absolutely no pressure. Just like an angel's wing.You don't have to spend all your time thinking about what you're doing, you just let it happen.  We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</div>
